# React Weather App

This project is a weather forecasting web application built with ReactJS. It provides users with real-time weather information for their location or any city they choose. The application is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, leveraging weather data from a weather API.

## Features

- **Current Weather**: View real-time weather conditions including temperature, humidity, and weather description.
- **City Search**: Search for weather information by city name.


## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: Frontend library used for building the user interface.
- **Weather API**: Integrated to fetch weather data. (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI)
- **Bootstrap**: Styling to create a responsive and user-friendly design.

## Installation

    ```

3. **Set up API credentials:**

    REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key
    ```

4. **Start the development server:**
